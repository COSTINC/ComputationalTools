Developed by Graeme Thorn in the [Teif Lab] (https://generegulation.org)

## Description

This program, reads through each line of the BED file, extracts the sequence from the reference, computes the binding affinities using the TRAP algorithm described in [Roider et al., 2007] (https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/23/2/134/204665) for the given PWM, aggregates the affinities to calculate the average profile across the given regions.
