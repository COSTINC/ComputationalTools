developed by Graeme Thorn

## Description

This program, reads through each line of the BED file, extracts the sequence from the reference, computes the binding affinities using the TRAP algorithm (Roider et al., 2007) for the given PWM, aggregates the affinities to calculate the average profile across the given regions.
