## Description

The method combines Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics numerical tools into an efficient coarse-grain scheme suitable for generating putative conformations of interphase chromosomes. The method is based on rigorous arguments of polymer physics and it may be easily adapted and generalized to simulate chromosomes under diverse external conditions.
The algorithm proceeds via two main steps: (1) "slow" relaxation of the large scale chromosome structure by Monte Carlo; (2) "fast" relaxation of the local degrees of freedom via Molecular Dynamics.
