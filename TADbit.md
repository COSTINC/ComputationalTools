## Description
TADbit is a complete Python library to deal with all steps to analyze, model and explore 3C-based data. With TADbit the user can map FASTsQ files to obtain raw interaction binned matrices (Hi-C like matrices), normalize and correct interaction matrices, identify and compare the Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), build 3D models from the interaction matrices, and finally, extract structural properties from the models. TADbit is complemented by TADkit for visualizing 3D models.
Hi-C experiments generate genomic interaction between loci located in the same or in different chromosomes. TADbit is built around the concept of a chromosome, and uses it as a central item to store and compare different Hi-C experiments. The library has been designed to be used by researchers with no expertise in computer science. All-in-one scripts provided in TADbit allow to run the full analysis using one single command line; advanced users may produce their own programs using TADbit as a complementary library.
