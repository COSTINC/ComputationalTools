## Description
PHi-C allows for deciphering Hi-C data into polymer dynamics simulations and 3D structure sampling consistent with input Hi-C matrix data. PHi-C assumes that a genomic region of interest at an appropriate resolution can be modeled using a polymer network model, including attractive and repulsive interactions between monomers. Instead of finding optimized 3D conformations, PHi-C's optimization procedure provides optimal interaction parameters of the polymer network model. We can then reconstruct an optimized contact matrix. Finally, we can perform polymer dynamics simulations of the polymer network model equipped with the optimal interaction parameters.
