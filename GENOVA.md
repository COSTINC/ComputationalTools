## Description

GENOVA is a user-friendly R-package to analyse and visualise conformation capture data. It includes the most common Hi-C analyses, such as compartment and insulation score analysis. It can create annotated heatmaps to visualise the contact frequency at a specific locus and aggregate Hi-C signal over user-specified genomic regions such as loops, TADs and ChIP-seq data. GENOVA supports output from the major mapping-pipelines and loop-callers.
