## Description

essHi-C is a method to isolate the specific, or essential component of Hi-C matrices from the aspecific portion of the spectrum that is compatible with random matrices. Systematic comparisons shows that essHi-C improves the clarity of the interaction patterns, enhances the robustness against sequencing depth, allows the unsupervised clustering of experiments in different cell lines and recovers the cell-cycle phasing of single-cells based on Hi-C data. Thus, essHi-C provides means for isolating significant biological and physical features from Hi-C matrices.
