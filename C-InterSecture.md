## Description

С-InterSecture allows systematic comparison of genome architecture between species. C-InterSecture performsstatistical comparison of contact frequencies of individual pairs of loci, as well as interspecies comparison of contacts pattern within defined genomic regions, i.e. topologically associated domains.
