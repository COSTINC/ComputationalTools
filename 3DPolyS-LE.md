## Description

Recent studies suggest that the loop extrusion activity of Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes complexes is central to proper organization of genomes in vivo. Polymer physics-based modeling of chromosome structure has been instrumental to assess which structures such extrusion can create. Only few laboratories however have the technical and computational expertise to create in silico models combining dynamic features of chromatin and loop extruders. Here, we present 3DPolyS-LE, a self-contained, easy to use modeling and simulation framework allowing non-specialists to ask how specific properties of loop extruders and boundary elements impact on 3D chromosome structure. 3DPolyS-LE also provides algorithms to compare predictions with experimental Hi-C data.
