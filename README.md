# Computational Tools
*Database of computational tools developed by members of the International Nucleome Consortium*

This repository lists the computational tools developed by COST INC (http://inc-cost.eu/) members for data analysis and modeling in the context of 4D Genomics.

This summary table enumerates (non-exhaustively) the tasks performed by the different tools:
- **Hi-C generation**: functions to treat Hi-C raw data to generate Hi-C matrices 
- **Hi-C analysis**: functions to analyze Hi-C data to infer/compare compartments, TADs, structural motifs, etc. 
- **Hi-C visualization**: functions to visualize Hi-C data 
- **Image analysis**: functions to treat and analyse images or movies from microscopy 
- **Integrative 3D modeling**: top-down reconstructions of 3D genome conformations from 4D genomics data 
- **Biophysical modeling**: bottom-up biophysical/polymer/mechanistic models to predict chromatin organization based on specified mechanisms 
- **Statistical modeling**: statistical/AI models to predict contacts, TAD boundaries, structural motifs, etc. based on genomics data
