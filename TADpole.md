developed by Marti-Renom Laboratory at CNAG-CGR

## Description
TADpole, a computational tool designed to identify and analyze the entire hierarchy of TADs in intra-chromosomal in- teraction matrices. TADpole combines principal com- ponent analysis and constrained hierarchical clustering to provide a set of significant hierarchical chromatin levels in a genomic region of interest.
