## Description

DPredictor is machine-learning based method, which allows obtaining high-quality predictions of chromatin interactions in mammalian cells using information on gene expression and CTCF-binding. One can use 3DPredictor to predict ectopic interactions which appear after chromosomal rearrangements or to predict cell-type specific promoter-enhancer contacts in normal genome. Both model training code and trained models are available at github. Web-implementation is also provided (https://genedev.bionet.nsc.ru/Web_3DPredictor/) and requires no bioinformatic skills to predict contacts for a region of interest.
