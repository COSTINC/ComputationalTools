developed by Marti-Renom Laboratory at CNAG-CGR

## Description
Binless, a resolution-agnostic method that adapts to the quality and quantity of available data, to detect both interactions and differences. Binless relies on an alternate representation of Hi-C data, which leads to a more detailed classification of paired-end reads.
