## Description

Chrom3D is a computational platform for 3D genome modeling that simulates the spatial positioning of chromosome domains relative to each other and relative to the nuclear periphery. Chrom3D takes as input data significant pairwise chromatin interactions determined from a Hi-C contact matrix, and interactions with the nuclear periphery determined by ChIP-seq or DamID on nuclear lamins.
