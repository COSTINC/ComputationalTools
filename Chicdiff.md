## Description

Chicdiff is a pipeline for identifying differential Capture Hi-C interactions between two conditions.
Chicdiff takes advantage of Capture Hi-C parameters learned by the Chicago pipeline, and requires that the data for each replicate of each condition be processed by Chicago first. Please refer to the [Chicago](CHiCAGO.md) page for details on using this pipeline.
